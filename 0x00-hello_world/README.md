# C - Hello, World

In this project, I have learned about various concepts in C programming, including compilation using `gcc`, entry points using `main`, and text-printing functions.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Preprocessor**
  * [0-preprocessor](./0-preprocessor): This is a Bash script that runs a C file, which is stored in the `$CFILE` variable, through the preprocessor and saves the result in a file named `c`.

* **1. Compiler**
  * [1-compiler](./1-compiler): This is a Bash script that compiles a C file, which is stored in the `$CFILE` variable, without linking, and saves the output in a file with the same name but with a `.o` extension.
    * Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the output will be `main.o`.

* **2. Assembler**
  * [2-assembler](./2-assembler): This is a Bash script that generates the assembly code for a C file, which is stored in the `$CFILE` variable, and saves the result in a file with the same name but with a `.s` extension.
    * Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the result will be `main.s`.

* **3. Name**
  * [3-name](./3-name): This is a Bash script that compiles a C file, which is stored in the `$CFILE` variable, and creates an executable named `cisfun`.

* **4. Hello, puts**
  * [4-puts.c](./4-puts.c): This is a C program that prints the following line: `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"`, followed by a new line, using the `puts` function.

* **5. Hello, printf**
  * [5-printf.c](./5-printf.c): This is a C program that prints the following line: `"With proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art"`, followed by a new line, using the `printf` function.

* **6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation**
  * [6-size.c](./6-size.c): This is a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

* **7. Intel**
  * [100-intel](./100-intel): This script generates the assembly code in Intel syntax for a C file, which is stored in the `$CFILE` variable, and saves the result in a file with the same name but with a `.s` extension.
    * Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the output will be `main.s`.

* **8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity**
  * [101-quote.c](./101-quote.c): This is a C program that prints the following line to the standard error: `"and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19"`, followed by a new line. It does not use the `printf` or `puts` functions listed in the `NAME` section of the man(3) documentation.
