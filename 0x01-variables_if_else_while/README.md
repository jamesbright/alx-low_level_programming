# C - Variables, if-else, while

This project focuses on using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators in C. It involves practicing the declaration and definition of variables of type `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`, as well as utilizing `if` and `if...else` statements, and implementing `while` loops.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  * [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c): This C program generates a random number and prints whether it is positive or negative, followed by a new line. It performs the following tasks:
    * Completes [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c).
    * Stores a different random number every time the program is run.
    * Prints the number followed by `is positive` if the number is greater than 0, `is zero` if the number is zero, or `is negative` if the number is less than 0.

* **1. The last digit**
  * [1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c): This C program generates a random number and prints the last digit of that number, followed by a new line. It performs the following tasks:
    * Completes [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c).
    * Stores a different value every time the program is run.
    * Prints the string `Last digit of` [number] `is` [last_digit] `and is` followed by `greater than 5` if the digit is greater than 5, `0` if the digit is 0, or `less than 6 and not 0` if the digit is less than 6 and not 0.

* **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  * [2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c): This C program prints the lowercase alphabet in order, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.

* **3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  * [3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c): This C program prints the lowercase alphabet, followed by the uppercase alphabet, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly three times.

* **4. alphABET**
  * [4-print_alphabt.c](./4-print_alphabt.c): This C program prints the lowercase alphabet except for the letters 'q' and 'e', followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.

* **5. Numbers**
  * [5-print_numbers.c](./5-print_numbers.c): This C program prints all the single-digit numbers in base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

* **6. Numberz**
  * [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c): This C program prints all the single-digit numbers in base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice without using any variables of type `char`.

* **7. Smile in the mirror**
  * [7-print_tebahpla.c](./7-print_tebahpla.c): This C program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice
