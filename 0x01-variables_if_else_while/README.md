# C - Variables, if-else, while

This project focuses on using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators in C. It involves practicing the declaration and definition of variables of type `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`, as well as utilizing `if` and `if...else` statements, and implementing `while` loops.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  * [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c): This C program generates a random number and prints whether it is positive or negative, followed by a new line. It performs the following tasks:
    * Completes [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c).
    * Stores a different random number every time the program is run.
    * Prints the number followed by `is positive` if the number is greater than 0, `is zero` if the number is zero, or `is negative` if the number is less than 0.

* **1. The last digit**
  * [1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c): This C program generates a random number and prints the last digit of that number, followed by a new line. It performs the following tasks:
    * Completes [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c).
    * Stores a different value every time the program is run.
    * Prints the string `Last digit of` [number] `is` [last_digit] `and is` followed by `greater than 5` if the digit is greater than 5, `0` if the digit is 0, or `less than 6 and not 0` if the digit is less than 6 and not 0.

* **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  * [2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c): This C program prints the lowercase alphabet in order, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.

* **3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  * [3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c): This C program prints the lowercase alphabet, followed by the uppercase alphabet, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly three times.

* **4. alphABET**
  * [4-print_alphabt.c](./4-print_alphabt.c): This C program prints the lowercase alphabet except for the letters 'q' and 'e', followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.

* **5. Numbers**
  * [5-print_numbers.c](./5-print_numbers.c): This C program prints all the single-digit numbers in base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

* **6. Numberz**
  * [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c): This C program prints all the single-digit numbers in base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice without using any variables of type `char`.

* **7. Smile in the mirror**
  * [7-print_tebahpla.c](./7-print_tebahpla.c): This C program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice
Apologies for the incomplete response. Here's the continuation of the tasks:

* **8. Hexadecimal**
  * [8-print_base16.c](./8-print_base16.c): This C program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly three times.

* **9. Patience, persistence, and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
  * [9-print_comb.c](./9-print_comb.c): This C program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using only the `putchar` function exactly four times without using any variables of type `char`. The following conditions apply:
    * Numbers are separated by a comma `,` followed by a space.
    * Numbers are printed in ascending order.

* **10. 00...99**
  * [10-print_comb2.c](./10-print_comb2.c): This C program prints the numbers from `00` to `99`, using only the `putchar` function exactly five times without using any variables of type `char`. The following conditions apply:
    * Numbers are separated by a comma `,` followed by a space.
    * Numbers are printed in ascending order with two digits.

* **11. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
  * [100-print_comb3.c](./100-print_comb3.c): This C program prints all possible different combinations of two digits, using only the `putchar` function exactly five times without using any variables of type `char`. The following conditions apply:
    * Numbers are separated by a comma `,` followed by a space.
    * The two digits are different.
    * `01` and `10` are considered the same combination of the digits `0` and `1`.
    * Only the smallest combination of two digits is printed.
    * Numbers are printed in ascending order.

* **12. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...**
  * [101-print_comb4.c](./101-print_comb4.c): This C program prints all possible different combinations of three digits, using only the `putchar` function exactly six times without using any variables of type `char`. The following conditions apply:
    * Numbers are separated by a comma `,` followed by a space.
    * The three digits are different.
    * `012`, `120`, `102`, `021`, `201`, and `210` are considered the same combination of the digits `0`, `1`, and `2`.
    * Only the smallest combination of three digits is printed.
    * Numbers are printed in ascending order.

* **13. Software is eating the World**
  * [102-print_comb5.c](./102-print_comb5.c): This C program prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers, using only the `putchar` function exactly eight times without using any variables of type `char`. The following conditions apply:
    * Numbers range from `0` to `99`.
    * Two numbers are separated by a space.
    * Numbers are printed with two digits (e.g., `1` is printed as `01`).
    * `00 01` and `01 00` are considered the same combination of the numbers `0` and `1`.
    * Combinations of numbers are separated by a comma `,` followed by a space.
    * Combinations of numbers are printed in ascending order.
